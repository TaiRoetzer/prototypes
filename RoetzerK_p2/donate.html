                <h2>Who we support:</h2>
                <p>We provide equal-access music education opportunities with scholarships and instrument programs that
                    encourage local young people to express themselves through music.<br><br>

                    For the past eleven years the Oak Harbor Music Festival has provided a weekend of free musical
                    entertainment in the City of Oak Harbor, on beautiful Whidbey Island.<br><br>

                    The festival has provided a total of over $60,000 in scholarships to dozens of Whidbey Island
                    graduating seniors who plan to study music or build their performance skills in college.</p>

                <h2>Who you<br> could help:</h2>
                <p>New in 2022, the Quarter Note Fund for Young Musicians will help our Whidbey Island schools provide
                    instruments for use by children who can't afford to rent or buy their own. Students with passion for
                    music, and talent and desire to learn, should have an obstacle-free chance to follow their
                    dreams.<br><br>

                    The Oak Harbor Music Festival is a non-profit organization, so your donation will be tax
                    deductible.<br><br>

                    We would be sincerely thankful for any amount you are able to share.
